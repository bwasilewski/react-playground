# React Playground

The purpose of this project is to provide myself a simple environment for learning about, building, and testing React applications and components.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To view more information about how to perform common tasks, view the most recent version of the create-react-app guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
